Use this code at your own risk. It comes with no guarantees. And while it compiles using the latest version of Xcode, it doesn't work as expected.

This is code for the Easy Drag app that I released on the Mac App Store over a decade ago. But then Apple introduced some sandboxing requirements which prevented the app from functioning properly. After removing it from the App Store, I made it available as a free download on my site. However, since I stopped using it myself I haven't maintained it and it doesn't seem to work with the latest versions of macOS. 

The app had a decent user base and some appear to still want to use it. I often get asked to open-source it. So here it is. Feel free to fork it and fix it. I don't have time to debug it myself.
